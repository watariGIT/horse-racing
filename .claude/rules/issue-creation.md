# Issue Creation Rule

- File discovered improvements and future work items as GitHub Issues
- Do not include out-of-scope work in the current PR
- Apply appropriate labels:
  - `enhancement`: Feature improvements / new features
  - `bug`: Bug fixes
  - `infrastructure`: Infra / CI/CD related
  - `P0` - `P3`: Priority levels (P0 = highest)
